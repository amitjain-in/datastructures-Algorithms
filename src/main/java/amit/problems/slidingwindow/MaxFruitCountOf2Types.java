/**
 * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
 * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 * <p>
 * You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e.,
 * you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * <p>
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
 * <p>
 * Pattern //sliding window
